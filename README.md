# Project Success Prediction using Python, Machine Learning, and NLP

## Overview

This project aims to predict the success rates of production and delivery projects based on comprehensive ERP data. Leveraging Python's machine learning and natural language processing capabilities, the model assesses various factors such as order details, production status, and textual descriptions to forecast on-time delivery and overall project success.

## Dataset

The dataset is extracted from a real-world ERP system, containing:

- Order information including items ordered, production requirements, and timestamps  
- Textual descriptions related to orders and production processes  
- Customer satisfaction scores collected over multiple years (used as a feature for prediction)
